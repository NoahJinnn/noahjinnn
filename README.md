### Current work

`Sr SWE at Silence Laboratories | Rust, DevSecOps | E2EE and Decentralized tech`

Build several apps, SDKs and a distributed network that leverages MPC-TSS technology:

- Build a high-performance distributed network for decentralized threshold signature schemes (MPC-TSS) in Rust. Implement multi-factor authentication frameworks: Passkey, Web3 wallet authentication, OAuth. Develop different curve signature schemes: Ed25519, Secp256k1 for ECDSA and Schnorr protocol for authentication and on-chain transaction signing.

- Create Go, Rust, JavaScript client SDKs that integrate with low-level cryptographic primitives and communicate with the network. The SDKs are cross-platform and seamlessly integrated with wallet providers.

- Build web app and mobile for a self-custodial wallet integrating MetaMask Snap. Implement secure multi-factor authentication using threshold cryptography.

- Set up CI/CD to automate SDLC. Design and unblock performance bottlenecks to achieve SLO/SLA.
